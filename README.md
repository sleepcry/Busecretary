Busecretary

##Philosophy
Time leads to space,space leads to substance,substance leads to soul.

I don`t have that time to remember what I planed to do next. I need
a notification,clearly and simply.

## What
I am trying to manage my TODO business simply and clearly.So I need a 
secretary,a smart business secretary, that`s why I call it Busecretary.

##Why
Insofar as we know,there are already so many calendar apps,why don`t
I use them.Simply saying,they are too comlex or too pool.

I always forget something, and I want to be notified when it is time
to do something. However, the existent apps cannot satisfy my 
requirement fully. Alarm can simply notify me every day, and only a
few alarms can be set. The calendar is complex to use and cannot set
the event freely. So I want to combine the alarm and the calendar
together. Collect both one`s advantage and discard their disadvantage.

That`s why the Busecretary  is conceived.

##How
I need to be notified clearly and customizedly. So far as I can 
imagine,I`d like to set a notification as followings:

1,select a time (day, hour, minute, second, etc.), choose a notify
ring, describe the alarm, and you will be notified at that time.

2, select a time (hour, minute, second, etc.), set notify me every
day, describe the alarm, choose a ring, this is similar to traditional
alarm. 

3, set a notification following step 1, and set another notification
for each day following step 2, and then set some other notification
following step 1 or step 2. That means, you can set as many
notification as you want. 

4,Instead of choice a ring on you phone and a write a description,
you can record some words. When time run expired, the words will be
repeated.

This can help us with our daily time allocation and remind us some
special events.
