##Philosophy
Time leads to space,space leads to substance,substance leads to soul.   
I don``t have that time to remember what I planed to do next. I need   
a notification,clearly and simply.   

## What
I``m trying to manage my TODO business simply and clearly.So I need a    
secretary,a smart business secretary, that``s why I call it Busecretary.

##Why
Insofar as we know,there are already so many calendar apps,why don``t   
I use them.Simply saying,they are too comlex or too pool.   
I always forget something, and I want to be notified when it is time   
to do something. However, the existent apps cannot satisfy my    
requirement fully. Alarm can simply notify me every day, and only a   
few alarms can be set. The calendar is complex to use and cannot set   
the event freely. So I want to combine the alarm and the calendar   
together. Collect both one``s advantage and discard their disadvantage.   
That``s why the Busecretary  is conceived.   

##How
I need to be notified clearly and customizedly. So far as I can    
imagine,I``d like to set a notification as followings:    

* select a time (day, hour, minute, second, etc.), choose a notify   
ring, describe the alarm, and you will be notified at that time.
*  select a time (hour, minute, second, etc.), set notify me every   
day, describe the alarm, choose a ring, this is similar to traditional
alarm. 
*  set a notification following step 1, and set another notification   
for each day following step 2, and then set some other notification   
following step 1 or step 2. That means, you can set as many   
notification as you want.    
* Instead of choice a ring on you phone and a write a description,   
you can record some words. When time run expired, the words will be   
repeated.   
This can help us with our daily time allocation and remind us some   
special events.
