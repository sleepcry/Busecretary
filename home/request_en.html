<h3>Three steps to request a location:</h3>
<ul>
<li>select contact whose location you want to know.</li>
<li>write a message which will be sent to the person you request.</li>
<li>click <b>ok</b> to sent a SMS to the persons you picked at the first step.</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to now, a request has been sent to some persons. Next, you just wait for the response.<br/>
When an answer from someone has been received, you will get a notification clicking which can guide you<br/>
to view the reported location.</p>
<p>The sent requests and received reports can all be viewed in <a href="history_en.html">history</a>
