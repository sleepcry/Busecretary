#Busecretary conceive

##Name explanation
Business secretory

##Project aim
 	Practice my android technology and improve my portfolio.

##Project description
I always forget something, and I want to be notified when it`s time to do something. However, the existent apps cannot satisfy my requirement fully. Alarm can simply notify me every day, and only a few alarms can be set. The calendar is complex to use and cannot set the event freely. So I want to combine the alarm and the calendar together. Collect both one`s advantage and discard their disadvantage. That`s why the Busecretary  is conceived.

##Use case
1,select a time (day, hour, minute, second, etc.), choose a notify ring, describe the alarm, and you will be notified at that time.
2, select a time (hour, minute, second, etc.), set notify me every day, describe the alarm, choose a ring, this is similar to traditional alarm. 
3, set a notification following step 1, and set another notification for each day following step 2, and then set some other notification following step 1 or step 2. That means, you can set as many notification as you want. 

This can help us with our daily time allocation and remind us some special events.

##UI design
 	1, the basis is like the traditional Alarm, not the calendar. You can select the exact time, the ring you want to play, the description you want to notify you, and etc.
 	2, switch from one notification to another is just drag the view to left or right. Like the android desktop, drag the view to left will lead to the next notification, while dragging to right will lead to the previous notification.
 	3, style & theme: using the dark theme and the Alarm app time picker style, that is, a a round wheel you can rotate to select time, I think it`s cool!
 	4, Widget: designing a widget to scan the notification or some action on them. Such as suspend, remove, modify the repeat attribute.
